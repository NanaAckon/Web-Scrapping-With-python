# 📰 News Articles Sentiment Analysis

This project involves the preprocessing and sentiment analysis of news article content using Python and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, visualization, and sentiment categorization of textual data from news articles.

# Overview:
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of news articles about Nigeria’s economy from 2021 until now,2025. By examining these articles, we want to understand the overall tone—whether the stories are positive, negative, or neutral—and see how the media’s view of the economy has changed over time.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd news-sentiment-analysis

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')


## Text Preprocessing Steps
- Removed punctuation and special characters

- Converted text to lowercase

- Tokenized text into words

- Removed stopwords

- Lemmatized each word

- Reconstructed the cleaned text for analysis

## 📈 Visualizations
-Sentiment Distribution: Bar plot showing the count of articles by sentiment.

- Word Clouds: Visual representation of the most frequent words in positive, neutral, and negative articles.


## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced sentiment analysis using transformer models
- Dashboard for real-time sentiment tracking
- Include named entity recognition (NER) for topic insights
